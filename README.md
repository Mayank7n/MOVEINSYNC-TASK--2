-->I have used BootStrap for the UI.
-->Used documentations to make proper UI and proper backend.
-->There are two logins admin and user.
-->Admin can add events and admin can also register for the events.
-->Admin can also update the events and can also delete the events.
-->User can only book the events and can also Cancel the events and can also view the events.
